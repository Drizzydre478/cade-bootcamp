# Business Problem

Unless you work at Google or some lower level Technology company, you will probably be writing business applications.  They need to solve a business problem.  So keeping the business problem front and center and learning to talk about the business problem is a critical (yet poorly untaught) skill.  So we are going to make up a problem and work our way through it. 

#### Senario
You work at a large hypothetical home improvement company called `House Awesome` We have phyiscal stores throughout all of the Americas and a solid well known website.  

#### Business Problem:
For us to keep up with the markeplace, we need to build a single system for both the stores and the website to call to list our products and their prices.

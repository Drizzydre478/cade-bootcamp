# System Architecture

So after looking through our 3 Tiers and talking with those who we trust, here is what we settled on. 

* Database
  * Postgres
* Backend
  * Language: Spring Boot 2.0
  * Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Frontend
  * React

This is a great stack. This will give you tons of flexibility. Spring Boot has tons of features to get started quickly and a large community to help. On a side note, I've picked up GOLang in the last 6 months, and if you are looking for something that is the polar opposite of Spring Boot, then GOLang, is light, fast, clean and completely devoid of magic. So if wanting something different, give it a try.

# Database

This should take the most thought.  There are some great website about choosing your database.

* SQL(Relational) Open Source Options  
  * Postgres
  * MySQL
  * MariaDB
* SQL(Relational) Commercial Options
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
  * IBM DB2
* NoSQL Options
  * Cassandra (wide column)
  * MongoDB (document db)
  * Redis (key/value)


If you are unsure, Postgres is always a great safe choice.  There are some powerful NoSQL options, but like anything, they are a solution. Meaning they must fit the problem.  Start with the data and the needs of the data, then that will drive the DB options.

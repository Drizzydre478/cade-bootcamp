# Cade Thacker's Business App Bootcamp

I am a mentor to many young engineers both in and out of college, and I had this idea kicking around to create a quick "business app bootcamp".  Hopefully you all find this useful.  Feedback and Pull Requests are very welcome.  

It is written for Java / Spring Boot, but the structure can easily be applied to **ANY** langauge, but you will need to do the googling to get your laptop setup with that runtime environment.  GOLang, NodeJS, Java, Spring Boot, I can see how those would all easily fit into this. Enjoy the hacking....

**Target Audience** This is not for the absolute begininer. I'm not going to give you step by step to setup your environment, but if you are competent at googling answers, and setting up your environmnet on your laptop, then this is for you! But I did try to feed you the problem a small step at a time. 

## Engineer Mindset

To be a good engineer you need a few key attributes:

* Bottomless well of optimism
* Natural Curiosity
* Jack of all trades, master at none
* Ability to seperate "signal to noise"
* Learn to talk to the business team

## Optimism

This line of work requires long hours of focused concentration. If you are easily fustrated or get bored quickly when things don't go your way, well, might want to rethink your career choice :D When your life partner says `are you going to sleep or not, I can't wait up any longer, I'm going to bed` and you say `I almost have this working and as soon as it does, I'm going to bed, be there in 5 minutes, I promise` and 3 hours later, it is still `almost working`.  haha. 

## Curiosity

`I wonder if...` is one of the most powerful phrases in the human vocabulary. Dream big, but then get ready to get to work. Always be willing to peel back the onion one more layer. Google *EVERYTHING* If you see a word or phrase you don't know. *STOP* and google it until you have a basic understanding. 

## Jack of all Trades, Master of None

This has served me well in my career.  I have a good friend who is a multi-instrumentalist.  He can play like 20 different instruments.  But he will be quick to tell you, he is the master of none of them.  He just loves the freedom to shift around.  Now it doesn't mean you shouldn't have a "base".  His "base" is keyboard, but then he branched from there.  My base is "Java" but I'm also decent at python, nodejs, react, and many others. 

## Signal to Noise

The amount of "noise" in technology can be overwhelming. Learn when to stop going down the rat hole. There are tons of rat holes in Technology.  Learn just enough to make an informed decision and move on.  Run your ideas past somebody you trust, make the decision and try not to look back. 

## Learn Business Speak

This skill needs to be emphasised more in school and work.  If you are working on a business app, then *LEARN* the business.  If it is pricing, then learn the basics of retail pricing. Some of this will come by osmosis, but push yourself to speak the business team's language. When you are in a meeting with the business and you hear youself start talking technology to the business team, **STOP STOP STOP** and elevate your speach back to business teams. This will save you lots of heartache and make you look like a super star.

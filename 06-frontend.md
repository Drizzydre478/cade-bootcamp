# Frontend

The Frontend, generally refers to the browser. But not always. But for this discussion, we will talk about the frontend as the browser. 

On the browser the battle has been won:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

So the only real question is if you will use a library:
* React 
* Angular
* jQuery
*  None (just code in plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript)


This has created tons of flame wars online about which is better. I am currently a fan of react, but I'm sure it will be replaced at some point by a new "cool kid".  Just like every other library in the history of the world. :D
